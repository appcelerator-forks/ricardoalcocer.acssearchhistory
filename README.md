# ACS Search Demo

This sample app was developed by Leor Brenman from Appcelerator, and explain in [this blog post](http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2014/08/implementing-recent-history-in-your-appcelerator-apps).

In order to use this project, make sure you import it into Titanium Studio and select the checkbox that says "Cloud-enable this application", which will activate an ACS backed for your app.
