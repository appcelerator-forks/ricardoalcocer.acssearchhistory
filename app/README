Simple ACS Use case

Use ACS Custom Objects to save search history across device

On a mobile device, entering text is painful. When you search for something,
say a Product in an ERP system or an Account in a CRM system, there is great
chance that you will be searching for that item again.

Furthermore, many mobile users have multiple devices, say an Android for work
and an iPad at home. When you do a search on the Android Phone and then later
do a search on your iPad at home, it would be nice to see the search history
synced across device.

This demo shows this search history concept in a company search form.

Press your finger in the search field and see previous searches in red.

Enter a character and a search of companies will execute in the form of an
autocomplete (along with the search history results at the bottom).

When you click on a company in the search results, that company and stock
symbol will be saved in yoursearch history. Again, this can be applied to
any application or search.

Clicking on the "i" button brings up the about window.

Long Pressing on the "i" button clears your search history.
